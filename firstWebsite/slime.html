    <h2>Danger Rating: 1/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: "Can you move any slower.."</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Slimes like other indoor monsters spawn from vents. 
       They travel extremely slowly towards players. 
       It takes slimes to hits to kill a full health player so don't worry about getting one shot.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Use railings to get around slimes as they can't hit you when you're on it. 
       It is possible to sprint jump over slimes, so remember that when you're being chased and run into a slime.
