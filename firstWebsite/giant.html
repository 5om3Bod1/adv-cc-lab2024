    <h1>Forest Keeper</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 8/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Use terrain to your advantage</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Forest Keepers can be found at around the 5 to 6pm. 
       You can hear them loudly stomping about from a distance. 
       Be aware that Forest Keepers have an insane line of sight. 
       Most of the times they have spotted you before you spottd them. 
       Once they spot a player, they will proceed to storm towards them.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Most of the times you the player can't out run the giant, so its best to try and break line of sight when trying to run away. 
       Even better is have another player bait the giant away with a third player on the ship ready to teleport them back. 
       Also note that giants can't hear so discuss with your teammates on how to go about the giant.
