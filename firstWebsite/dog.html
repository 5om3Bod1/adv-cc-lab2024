    <h1>Eyeless Dog</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 6/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: <em>shhhh..</em></p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Eyeless dogs in their name can't see, but they have extremely good hearing. 
       Relying only on thier hearing as a means of locating players. 
       Best when you see a dog is to remain quiet and if they are far enough quickly warn teammates of the dog. 
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>The dogs can be easily baited by a teammate either through proximity chat or any form of sound. 
       Even better is if you have the money to spare, buy a walkie talkie from the store. 
       Wait until the package drops creating a lot of noise to attrach the dogs. 
       Making it easier for you and your teammates to get back into the ship.
