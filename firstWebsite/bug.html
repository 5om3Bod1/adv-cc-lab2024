    <h1>Hoarding Bug</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 1/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Becareful when looting around them</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Hoarding Bugs like most other indoor monsters spawn through vents, initially they are harmless. 
       But when they see you taking loot infront of them they get aggressive (On the right is an example of this state), as they see the loot belonging to them. 
       You can also give it a piece of your loot as they will then grab it and scurry away. 
       If you choose to follow them, you might find their stash. 
       Which may host a bunch of them guarding it. 
       Stealing from their hoard again will result in them becoming aggressive.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>It takes three melee weapon smacks to kill one. 
        So you can bait them in by dropping one of your items. 
        As they walk up you prepare a swing, and when they turn aggressive all you need is two more hits to kill them.
