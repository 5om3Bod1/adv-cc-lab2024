    <h1>Spore Lizard</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 0/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Looks cute, just don't get to close</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Spore Lizard like other indoor monsters spawn from vents. 
       They may try to intimidate the player, but they are harmless. 
       If you get to close they will spare a pink gas, that is completely harmless. 
       Although if you make contact with them you will be damaged.
