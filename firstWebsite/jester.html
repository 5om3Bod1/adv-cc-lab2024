    <p><u>My two cent</u>: "Exit! WHERE ARE YOU!?"</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The Jester can be found on the higher diffuculty moons. 
        They will walk towards the player slowly, once in range will begint to crank their handle. 
        Once the cranking has begun, the player has thirty-five seconds to leave the facility or be hunted down. 
        When the Jester is in its attack form (Seen on the right), you can hear it run around the facility towards the nearest player. 
        Sounding very similar to the Coilhead running noise, except its a lot deeper of a sound.
