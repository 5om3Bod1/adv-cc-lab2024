    <h1>Bracken</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 6/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Always look behind you occasionally</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The Bracken like most other indoors monsters spawn from vents, so listen out for the vents opening. 
       They will try and sneak up on unsuspecting players and snap their necks. 
       When the Bracken is spotted they will either stand up if they were in hunting mode or stand still. 
       When this happens its best to not provide line of sight towards them directly. 
       If you stare at them twice or for too long, you will trigger their attack state. 
       They will then storm at you and murder you.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>You can't hear the Bracken when their sneaking around, so its best to look behind you occasionally. 
       Additonally check your corners, it might make the difference between spotting him and being stalked into being murdered. 
       Make sure to look out for their signiture two white dots for eyes.
