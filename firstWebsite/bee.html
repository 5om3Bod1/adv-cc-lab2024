    <h1>Circuit Bee</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 5/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Not dangerous unless you get close</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Circuit Bee hives can be found on some of the maps, they are completely harmless if you don't get near them. 
       Think of them like wasp, once you get to close to their home they start attacking. 
       The prospect of on average free 100 credits is always really tempting.
       Unless you know what you are doing, please don't try to be a hive runner. 
       You might end up killing your whole team. 
       (This is not a joke I've done it before, even with the amount of bee hives I've gotten.)
