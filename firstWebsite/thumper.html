    <h2>Danger Rating: 7/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Run around corners</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Thumper like other indoor monsters spawn from vents. 
       You can hear them crawl around the facility by their disinct crawling noises. 
       Which sound like a massive body of flesh being dragged around. 
       When spotted by the Thumper, it will proceeds to storm at the player ramping up in move speed. 
       If it crashes into a wall, the Thumper will be stunned for a moment.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Utalize corners when trying to escape the Thumper.

       Using a melee weapon can be a way to kill it, as successful hits resets its move speed.
