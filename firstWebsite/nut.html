    <h1>Nutcracker</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 8/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: <em>Shotgun..</em></p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The Nutcracker can be found on high tier moons. 
       As they patrol the facilities they reside in. 
       Armed with a shotgun, being spotted by it may mean your instant doom. 
       Getting to close to it may result in you getting kicked and killed.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>If you're not extremely close to the Nutcracker, by standing still the Nutcracker can't see you. 
       Doesn't mean they won't kick you if they make contact with you. 
       When fighting the Nutcracker make sure to attack when its eye is out. 
       Make sure to fight around corners and go in for swings when its reloading. 
       If you already have a shotgun, one shotgun blow will kill it.
