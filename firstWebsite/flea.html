    <h1>Snare Flea</h1>
    <h2>Danger Rating: 4/10</h2>
    <p><u>My two cent</u>: Look at the ceiling and don't panick</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>Snare Flea like most other indoor monsters spawn from vents. 
       They like to attach themselves onto the ceiling waiting for an unsuspecting player to walk under it. 
       Then it drops down and if it manages to get on a player. 
       The Snare Flea will proceed to sufficate the player to death.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>If your teammates have a shovel, have them wack the Snare Flea off you. 
        Make sure to kill it though after doing so, incase it runs off and repeats history.
        If your the victim and you have a shovel, when you get latched onto all your items drop. 
        Try to look down and grab your shovel, once you do that you can wack the Snare Flea off youself. 
        Exiting the facility also kills the Snare Flea.
